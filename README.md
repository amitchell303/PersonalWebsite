# Blocks 9 & 12

Instead of a website about myself, I made it about Kenny McCormick from South Park. Who doesn't love Kenny? 
Explore this site to learn more about Kenny's various alter egos, employment history, and secret identity:                
              *Mysterion*

I had a lot of fun with the project. I will likely continue to work on it and use it as a CSS playground. This workshop really allowed me to get comfortable styling using CSS. A few features I hope to add in the future:
  -  Navbar logo navigating to home
  -  animated South Park sign in footer
  -  add "prefessional references" to include Kenny's friends
  -  add image to contact form alert referencing scene
  -  clean up code overall, optimize nav/footer integration 
  -  refine styling
